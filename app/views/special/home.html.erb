  <h2>Help the open government initiative take flight!</h2>
  <p>
    Cell site placement has shifted from the "best location" practice of the larger cell towers to a "multiple location" 
    strategy in recent years. As a result shorter cell phone towers are appearing on the sides of buildings, faux trees, 
    and other various locations all over the country.
  </p>
  <p>
    The FCC requires the registration of cell phone towers and antennas that are near airports or of a certain height. 
    However they are not aware of the shorter cell phone towers. To further the goals of the Gov 2.0 / open data movement,
    All Your Cells was created.  
  </p>
  <p>  
    Most modern cell phones create location-aware photos (or you can add location coordinates yourself before submitting). 
    Now when you see a cell phone tower you can take a picture of it and email it to us. This data will allow FCC to supplement 
    their tall tower data and it will all be openly available via our <a href='/api'>API</a>.
